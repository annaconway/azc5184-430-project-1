        <h2>What is the bare minimum you need in your Routine?</h2>
        <h3>Cleanser [★☆☆]</h3>
        <p>It's a good idea to use a cleanser at night, to wash off the gunk that builds up throughout the day. In the morning, depending on your skin's needs, you can use a cleanser or simply rinse with water. </p>
        <p>A good cleanser is one that leaves your skin feeling <b>soft and maybe a bit moisturized</b> - not dry, tight, or ‘squeaky clean.’</p>
        <p>Some things to consider when evaluating how well your cleanser is working: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you feel product leftover after cleansing? If so, you may want to find a different cleanser or add a first cleanser like micellar water or oil cleansing!</li>

            <li>Does your face feel calm & soft? Great! Sounds like you’ve found a nice gentle cleanser.</li>

            <li>Does your skin feel irritated, tight, dry, or ‘squeaky clean’ after cleansing? Drop it and find a gentler cleanser!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your cleanser is gentle enough, doesn't break you out, and does what it's supposed to do, that's awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :) If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, gives you acne, or doesn't
            do what it should, it might be time to try a different one!
        </p>
        <p>Gentle cleansers are best with an acidic pH of no more than pH 5.6. Try and pay attention to cleansers that list the pH value on their website or bottle!</p>

        <h3>Moisturizer [★☆☆]</h3>
        <p>A good moisturizer nourishes the skin and improves our skin's barrier. That helps treat and prevent obvious things like dryness, but also less-obvious concerns like oiliness, acne, fine lines, and leftover acne marks. It’s especially important
            to have a good moisturizer (or a few!) if you plan on using any potentially irritating actives in the future.</p>
        <p>Some things to consider when evaluating how well your moisturizer is working: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does it leave your skin feeling bouncy and supple? Happy and healthy, not dry and tight, is what a good moisturizer is aiming for.</li>

            <li>How long does that moisturized feeling last? If it only lasts an hour or two, you may want to find a different moisturizer! Perhaps try a thicker moisturizer, like a cream or a balm.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your moisturizer is gentle enough, doesn't break you out, and does what it's supposed to do, that's awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :) </p>
        <p>If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, gives you acne, or doesn't do what it should, it might be time to try a different one!</p>

        <h3>Sunscreen [★☆☆]</h3>
        <p>Whenever we're exposed to the sun, it affects our skin in different ways. Some are good - it can boost our mood and influences our sleep-wake rhythm. But some are more harmful; it causes skin cancer and sunburns, as well as fine lines and hyperpigmentation.
        </p>
        <p>Sunscreens can be hard to evaluate since they’re about prevention, but some things to consider may include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does it have adequate UV protection? (SPF 30+ for UVB)</li>
            <li>Is it easy and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Is your hyperpigmentation worsening, or are you developing new freckles/dark spots? If so, you may need a sunscreen with higher protection!.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your sunscreen is gentle enough, doesn't break you out, and does what it's supposed to do, that's awesome! Go ahead and enjoy it as part of your skincare routine :) </p>
        <p>If it turns out that your product irritates your skin, gives you acne, or doesn't do what it should, it might be time to try a different one!</p>
